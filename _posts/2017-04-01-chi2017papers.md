HCI & Design at the University of Washington will again have a large and quality presence at CHI 2017,
the flagship annual conference for research and practice across all areas of HCI & Design.
University of Washington authors contributed to 45 papers,
with 3 selected for Best Paper Award recognition (given to the top 1% of submissions) 
and 9 selected for Best Paper Honorable Mention recognition (given to the top 5% of submissions).
    
This presence draws upon more than 10 different University of Washington departments and programs.
As in all aspects of DUB, interdisciplinary perspectives are the key to great research.
Congratulations to all of these authors, 
and to our outstanding colleagues and collaborators from industrial research and universities around the world.

We are also happy to celebrate Jacob O. Wobbrock's SIGCHI Social Impact Award,
recognizing his career of research in accessibility and ability-based design.
This recognition speaks to the strength and impact of the DUB community,
following on prior SIGCHI Social Impact Awards for Richard Ladner (2014) and Batya Friedman (2012).

Join us at CHI 2017 in Denver!
