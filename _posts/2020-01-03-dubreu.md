DUB is a grassroots alliance of faculty, students, researchers, and industry partners interested in Human Computer Interaction & Design at the University of Washington. Our mission is to bring together an interdisciplinary group of people to share ideas, collaborate on research, and advance teaching related to the interaction between design, people, and technology.

This year we are offering a summer research opportunity, available to undergraduate students. This research program encourages applications from students who would like to conduct research in the field of HCI, on topics ranging from accessibility, to fabrication, to health, to ICT4D, to robotics. We seeks broad participation, including members of underrepresented groups as defined by the National Science Foundation (i.e., African American, Hispanic, Native American, people with disabilities) who may be considering further graduate study in human-computer interaction or computer science.

If you are accepted into the REU program, you will be invited to participate in a paid 10-week internship during the summer in a research laboratory at the University of Washington. Based on your application, you will be matched with a specific project and mentored by the faculty member and associated graduate students or postdocs. You will learn about research through engagement in the project you are matched to, through interactions with other students, and through a weekly mentoring seminars focused on research and associated skills. Topics covered may include admissions, career opportunities, research ethics, and research paper writing. In addition, you will be invited to attend the DUB seminar for exposure to a wide range of research in HCI.

This experience will be excellent preparation if you are considering pursuing a Masters or Ph.D. degree. Past undergraduate students in DUB have been offered the chance to author a publication, and undergraduate interns who perform well frequently request reference letters from their mentors.   As such, this program is well suited to a student in the summer between their junior year and senior year of college. Students in other years may also apply, but students who will have already graduated by Summer 2019 are not eligible.

### REU Program Dates
The formal program begins on June 15 with a welcome reception and orientation, and concludes on August 21 with a poster session in the afternoon. Students are expected to stay for the entire 10 week period, work 40 hours a week, and make time to attend scheduled events such as the welcome reception, seminar, and final poster session. Some students may additionally make arrangements with individual faculty to arrive earlier and/or stay later.

### REU Program Benefits
Students will receive a stipend of $8,000.  Housing will not be provided, but is available through the university:

The REU program can help to facilitate this.

## Information about Applying

Students must be a U.S. Citizen or permanent resident to apply. Ths NSF is the primary funding source for the program and requires this for its funding of REU positions.

Students must be 18 years old or older.

Submission of an application indicates that the applicant agrees to be present for the entire summer program period.

The expected commitment is 40 hours per week, with no additional classes or jobs.

In addition, a strong application will have a minimum GPA of 3.5 and good class standing and/or grades in subjects relevant to the research area of interest.

We expect the program to have 10 to 20 positions this summer, though the number of students will depend on funding and the number and strength of the applications.
