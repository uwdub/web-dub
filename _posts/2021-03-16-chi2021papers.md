HCI & Design at the University of Washington will again have a large and quality presence at CHI 2021,
the flagship annual conference for research and practice across all areas of HCI & Design.
University of Washington authors contributed to 50 papers that are to be presented at CHI 2021,
including 4 selected for Best Paper Award recognition (given to the top 1% of submissions)
and 11 selected for Best Paper Honorable Mention recognition (given to the top 5% of submissions).

This presence draws upon more than 10 different University of Washington departments and programs.
As in all aspects of DUB, interdisciplinary perspectives are the key to great research.
Congratulations to all of these authors,
and to our outstanding colleagues and collaborators from industrial research and universities around the world.

We are also happy to celebrate the induction of Jeffrey Heer into the CHI Academy.
