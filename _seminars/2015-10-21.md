title:      "From Paid to Organic Crowdsourcing"

location:   "HUB 250"

abstract: |
  Human computation systems seamlessly combine human perception, creativity and knowledge with machine-driven 
  algorithmic computation.  Such systems have been demonstrated to accomplish tasks that could not previously be 
  accomplished by either machines or by non-experts alone.  Contemporary human computation systems frequently recruit 
  human contributions from online micro-labor markets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk.  While convenient, this approach 
  limits the scale, scope and quality of work.

  In contrast, my group's work has contributed to a largely unexplored area of "organic" crowdsourcing, an area that 
  builds on insights from social computing research and on recent advances in human computation.  In organic 
  crowdsourcing, intrinsically motivated people contribute to human computation workflows as a byproduct of performing 
  activities that they find inherently valuable.  In successful organic crowdsourcing systems, the addition of the 
  human computation element enhances (instead of detracting from) the main activity, while also resulting in useful 
  work being done.  For example, with our Crowdy system, people learning from tutorial videos get prompted with short 
  quizzes. The quizzes are designed such that by answering them, people contribute to a workflow that improves those 
  same videos for future learners.  The quizzes are also designed to be pedagogically valuable.  The results of our 
  study show that the improvements to the tutorial videos generated by Crowdy are comparable in quality to those 
  produced by experts.  Our results also demonstrate that people who view tutorial videos with Crowdy and participate 
  in quizzes learn more than people who watch the same videos with a traditional video interface.  I will present three 
  organic crowdsourcing projects from our group and share an initial synthesis of generalizable principles for the 
  design of organic crowdsourcing systems.

  Krzysztof Gajos is an associate professor of Computer Science at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and 
  Applied Sciences. Krzysztof is broadly interested in intelligent interactive systems, a research area that bridges 
  artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Recent projects pursued by his group contributed to diverse 
  areas such as personalized adaptive user interfaces, systems for supporting collective creativity, organic 
  crowdsourcing, large-scale experimentation in the wild, and learning technologies.

  Prior to arriving at Harvard, Krzysztof was a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research. He received his Ph.D. 
  from the University of Washington and his M.Eng. and B.Sc. degrees from MIT. In the Fall of 2005, he was visiting 
  faculty at the Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana, where he taught Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. Krzysztof 
  is a coeditor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems. He is a recipient of a Sloan 
  Research Fellowship.
