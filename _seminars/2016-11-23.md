title:      "Designing Increasingly Autonomous Vehicles to be Safer than Humans"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract: |
  Vehicles are becoming increasingly autonomous but are not as yet all fully driverless. Autonomous technology is being introduced in phases. This requires human drivers to continually adapt to their changing role inside the car. The humanâ€™s ability to decide when to take back control of the primary driving task is further complicated given system imperfections. As drivers adapt to increasing levels of automation, they may change their driving behaviour in ways that can compromise and even negate the intended system benefits. To design vehicles that account for limitations of both the human and the system, it is essential to model such behavioural adaptation. This presentation will focus on the challenges and opportunities in this modelling endeavour and their safety implications for all road users.
