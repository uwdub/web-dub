title:      "The Stark Future of Trust Online"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract: |
  Trust is what enables our society to function, from supporting interpersonal transactions to providing the very foundation of our democracy. How trust is established online is therefore a key question for HCI to understand and address, especially as the landscape is rapidly changing with AI and algorithms increasingly mediating our online experiences. This talk will cover two different and critical aspects of online trust.

  In the first part of the talk, I will present work on trust in the news media. Most people consume online news on platforms where algorithms present content from a mixed set of sources, for example news aggregators and news feeds. It is important, then, to evaluate the factors that contribute to how people evaluate the veracity of content in these environments. In this work, we follow on a body of research showing higher reported trust in politically aligned news sources. We investigate the determinants of the increased trust to distinguish between source evaluation and confirmation bias effects.

  It is more than recommendations algorithms that mediate our online experiences. In the second part of the talk, I will outline a near-future where our personal communications are mediated by AI agents, or as we termed it: AI Mediated Communication (AI-MC). I will lay out the various ways in which AI-MC might impact our interpersonal communications, and describe a study where we examined the potential impact of AI-generated profile text on the perceived trustworthiness of Airbnb hosts.

  Taken together, the findings point to a bleak future of trust in our society, and offer a set of significant challenges for the future of HCI.

  The studies I will present were led by PhD student Maurice Jakesch at Cornell, and are joint work with Jeff Hancock, Xiao Ma, and Karen Levy among others.
