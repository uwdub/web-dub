  The first week of each quarter focuses on communication and networking within the DUB community. 
  Instead of a seminar speaker, we hold a DUB faculty meeting and coordinate small group lunches.

  1) DUB Faculty Meeting

  The DUB faculty meeting is held at 12:00 in CSE 691 (i.e., Gates Commons).
  Lunch is provided. 
  When there are clear agenda items, those will be announced on the dub-faculty mailing list.

  2) Small Group Lunches

  The heart of the DUB community is our diversity of perspectives, 
  bringing together people and ideas that might otherwise be hidden in our units.
  We build this community in part through our plenary seminars, our retreat,
  and small group activities organized by members of the DUB community throughout the year.

  We do small group lunches like this:

  - Have lunch in a group of approximately 4 DUB people who all add something different
    (e.g., different departments, different research advisors, 
    different disciplinary background, different years in their program). 
    You decide what brings different perspectives to your DUB lunch.

  - As part of your lunch, be sure discussion includes possible small group activities
    (e.g., in the rest of the quarter, in the rest of the year).
    Consider activities that you could organize on a week that we do not have a plenary seminar,
    or consider other activities within the DUB community.

  - Send an email to speak [at] dub [dot] washington [dot] edu.
    Let us know what kind of small group activities you are considering.
    It is up to members of the DUB community to organize such activities,
    but let us know what you are thinking about and how we can facilitate and publicize activities.

    This is your homework from the lunch: the email can be short, but it is required.

  We have created a speadsheet to help find a small group for lunch, and to coordinate reimbursement.

  <http://tiny.cc/uwdub20180926>

  Keep your receipt, including both the itemized receipt and the signed receipt with any tip.
  We will reimburse approximately $50 for lunch with a group of 4.
  Initiate the reimbursement process by submitting this form:
