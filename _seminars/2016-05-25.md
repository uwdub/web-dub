title:      "The New Practice of Old Photography"

location:   "HUB 332"

abstract:   |
  A decade ago we saw the birth of Flickr, a media website for social 
  photo sharing. Since then, social media websites have grown to
  encompass many types of photo, video, audio, and even hyper-link
  sharing. Many researchers have conducted work on these social-websites
  in general yet there still exists many opportunities to explore how
  people engage with media online, specifically multimedia, in social
  contexts. However, the practice of photography itself is almost two
  centuries old.  What can we further understand about the modern
  practice of photography (selfies, food, and all) from the works and
  writings of the masters (both past and contemporary)? In this talk, I
  will highlight some new challenges for researchers studying social
  photography and present a few recent findings from an investigation of
  Flickr which include geographic annotation of photographs and regions,
  community congregation online, and social engagement.
