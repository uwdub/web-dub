title:      "The Hybrid Hand • Leveraging Sensor-based Approaches for Understanding and
Supporting Tacit Skills"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  Tacit knowledge is a type of knowledge often existing in one’s subconscious and
accessed through mechanisms like muscle memory. Such knowledge is pervasive in
creative and technical practices yet remains difficult to observe or codify. In this talk, I’ll
describe how sensor-based approaches can be used to support\: (1) how we identify
and understand tacit skills, and (2) how we can use these insights to design smart
interactive tools. 

  In the first part of the talk, I will describe a case study documenting the “emotional
rollercoaster” that typifies the tacit practice of debugging. Using physical sensors,
biosignals, and activity logs of 17 programmers using Jupyter notebooks, I will show
how codebook segmentation can be used to distill hundreds of hours of dense activity
data into a visually parsable representation we term process chromatograms. In the
context of programming, I will describe ways chromatograms can serve as an
ethnographic descriptor, knowledge mining technique, an evaluation metric, or a design-
informing visualization.

  In the second part of the talk, I will describe the challenges of building sensor-driven
interactions in a living glass workshop. I will explain the development of a sensing
infrastructure capable of training ad-hoc convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on
bespoke acoustic datasets and outline how this system navigates traditional challenges
of ubiquitous computing. Through a set of smart tools, I will describe a vision for
enabling information repositories of tacit knowledge to drive skill acquisition, distributed
learning, and sustain creative development.
