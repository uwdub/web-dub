  The DUB Faculty Meeting and DUB Small Group Mixers focus on communication and networking within the DUB community.
  These are currently hybrid, with each small group either virtual or in-person. 

  Mixers for {{ page.date | date: '%B %e, %Y' }} are being organized in this document:

  <p><a href="http://tiny.cc/uwdub20230104" target="_blank">http://tiny.cc/uwdub20230104</a></p>

  ### Introduction to DUB Small Group Mixers

  Instead of a seminar speaker, we hold a DUB faculty meeting and 
  coordinate small group mixers that can include an in-person lunch reimbursement.

  #### 1) DUB Faculty Meeting

  The DUB faculty meeting is held at 12:00 in CSE 691 (i.e., Gates Commons).
  Lunch is provided.
  When there are clear agenda items, those will be announced on the dub-faculty mailing list.

  #### 2) DUB Small Group Mixers

  DUB Small Group Mixers are intended to be lightweight and grassroot opportunities for staying connected.
  The heart of the DUB community is our diversity of perspectives,
  bringing together people and ideas that might otherwise be hidden in our units.
  Any member of the DUB community can and should host a mixer.
  We expect mixers to require little or no advance preparation.
  Participants may declare a topic of interest for a mixer, or they may decide to just connect and socialize.

  We aim to support both virtual and in-person mixers, 
  and we can help support in-person mixers through reimbursement of an associated lunch.

  _Virtual Mixers_
  
  To host a virtual mixer, use the organizing document to provide a Zoom link.
  As you decide whether to join an existing virtual mixer or start a new virtual mixer,
  be mindful of the virtual format and how many people can effectively participate in a given mixer.
  This will vary according to the plan for any mixer, so use your best judgment.

  _In-Person Mixers and Lunch Reimbursement_

  To host an in-person mixer, use the organizing document to suggest a location and format.
  Because of our current distributed nature, we do not expect in-person activities are necessarily at campus.

  In-person small group mixers can receive lunch reimbursement according to this process:

  - Sign up to organize a small group mixer lunch,
    including committing to coordinating a single reimbursement for the small group.
    Note reimbursement is limited to approximately $60 for lunch with a group of 4.

  - Have lunch in a group of approximately 4 DUB people who all add something different
    (e.g., different departments, different research advisors,
    different disciplinary background, different years in their program).
    You decide what brings different perspectives to your DUB mixers,
    but be sure that your group is mixing across the DUB community.

  - As part of your lunch, be sure discussion includes DUB and related activities
    (e.g., in the rest of the quarter, in the rest of the year).
    Consider activities that you could help organize,
    or consider other opportunities to contribute within the DUB community.

  - Send an email to speak [at] dub [dot] washington [dot] edu.
    Let us know what you are thinking about and how we can facilitate and publicize activities.

  - Keep your receipt, including both the itemized receipt and the signed receipt with any tip.
    We will reimburse approximately $60 for lunch with a group of 4.
    Initiate the reimbursement process by submitting this form:
