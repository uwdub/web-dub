title:      "Expressive Biosignals: Lightweight Social Cues for Social Connection"

location:   "CSE2 G01"

abstract: |
  In this talk, we will introduce the concept of expressive biosignals as a novel social cue to improve interpersonal communication. Expressive biosignals are sensed physiological data revealed between people to provide a deeper understanding of each other’s psychological states. We will present opportunities and challenges in integrating expressive biosignals into social contexts, highlighting our research on Animo - a smartwatch application we built and deployed that enables people to share and view each other’s biosignals. We will discuss new communication patterns afforded by expressive biosignals systems, as well as the potential for these systems to foster authentic emotional expression and lightweight social connection between people. This research scopes the design space for expressive biosignals and informs future interventions for a variety of social contexts, including interpersonal relationships, remote communication, and well-being. We will end the talk with a discussion on the steps we are taking next to deploy this work more broadly.
