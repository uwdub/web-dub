title:      "A Few Reflections on Computing Research During this Time of Crisis"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |

  The present health emergency, economic downturn, and technological disruption are sufficiently transformative that they demand we reflect on our research through a new lens. In this informal talk, I will cover three areas of my work that are top of mind because their importance may increase in the years that follow this tumultuous period. I will first discuss research from my lab at Northwestern that, over the long-term, seeks to create a computing technology paradigm that provides many more economic benefits to a much wider group of people. Next, I will summarize in-progress work at Microsoft that involves thinking about the changing nature of computing research and the implications of these changes for actors across the computing research ecosystem. Finally, I will briefly review an ongoing project that examines the critical role of computing research in economic downturns.

  This will be a talk with a small number of slides and a large amount of audience participation. There will be ample time to discuss what recent events mean to us as researchers in human-centered computing, and I will try to provide whatever reflections I can from my academic and industrial experience. I am looking forward to connecting with the DUB community during this difficult period.
