  Activities for {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} are being organized in this document:

  <http://tiny.cc/uwdub20181121>

  Please organize and sign up for activities by noon on the preceding Friday.
  We need to place food orders on Friday, it is difficult to plan for this if people are not signed up.
  We will prioritize food for activities and people who were signed up at the time of the order.

  ### Introduction to DUB Small Group Activities

  #### Purpose

  Small group activities complement the plenary DUB seminar with opportunities to organize and participate in smaller and more focused activities and discussions with the DUB community.  DUB has always been a grassroots organization, and small group activities aim to facilitate members of the community in connecting and engaging with each other.

  #### Examples of Activities

  We want to help promote the activities you want to see in the DUB community.  As some examples of potential activities, we can imagine small group activities organized around:

  - Book Clubs (e.g., discussions around a relevant reading)
  - Course Planning and Feedback (e.g., to gather feedback and input on potential courses)
  - Design Activities (e.g., design and ideation activities)
  - Interest Groups (e.g., discussions organized around themes of interest)
  - Organizational Planning (e.g., planning meetings for larger activities)
  - Panels (e.g., students sharing relevant experiences with internships, job searches)
  - Paper Swaps (e.g., sharing feedback on draft papers)
  - Practice Talks (e.g., several people giving talks and sharing feedback)
  - Project Feedback (e.g., in-progress feedback on capstone projects)
  - Research Pitches (e.g., a set of brief pitches for projects, for feedback or to recruit researchers)
  - Self-Care (e.g., discussions and support among students)
  - Skill Shares (e.g., students sharing relevant expertise and skills)
  - Volunteer Opportunities (e.g., organizing opportunities to contribute)

  This list of ideas is only intended to be suggestive, not exhaustive. Think of your own ideas. Small group activities are still new, but over time we aim to gather best practices for effective activities based on your experiences in this new structures. Please share your experiences.

  #### Space

  Hosts of small group activities will need to secure whatever space is needed by the activity. If you are not sure how to go about reserving space, feel free to ask for some help.

  #### Food

  DUB can help facilitate by providing pizza, but this needs to be arranged within a set of policies around food reimbursements and limited staff resources. We intend that participants will also generally supplement this by bringing their own lunches.

  To get a pizza for an activity:

  - Activities need at least 6 people who RSVP a week before the small group activities (i.e., enough for a pizza). We will order a few extra pizzas while we all work out this process, so please RSVP even if you have missed this cutoff.
  - Pizzas for all activities will be delivered to a centralized location.
  - A participant in each activity should volunteer to pick up the pizza from that location and bring it to the activity (i.e., allowing the host to focus on preparing for the activity itself).
  - Participants should ensure that people who RSVP'd have the priority for this pizza.

  For individuals with dietary restrictions (i.e., unable to eat a cheese or vegetarian pizza), an alternative option is:

  - Purchase lunch for up to $10.
  - Keep an itemized receipt, as required for all University of Washington food reimbursements.
  - Initiate a reimbursement by submitting this form:

  #### Timing

  We expect most activities will occur during the DUB time (i.e., Wednesdays 12:00 to 1:30).

  Some activities will benefit from additional time (e.g., a greater number of practice talks could be more comfortably scheduled across a longer period of time). Hosts of small group activities can use their judgment and should be sure to post the expected start and end times for an activity. Variations in timing may also prevent centralized coordination of pizza, in which case all participants will need to plan to bring their own lunches.

  #### Hosting and Participating

  Any member of the DUB community can and should host an activity.  A Google Doc is linked below, in which hosts can announce and organize activities and in which participants can RSVP.

  Hosts should use the template that is included in that document to provide relevant information, including an event description, location, times, and any limit on the number of people who can participate (e.g., because of space limits, the format of the activity).

  Participants should RSVP to at most one activity and attend the activity for which they RSVP. This is important for hosts to be able to plan, and for the coordination of pizza described above.
