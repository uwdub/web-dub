title:      "Share the Hands - UnlimitedHand: Interactivity through Human Hand Somatics"

location:   "HUB 334"

abstract: |
  Human sensations are formed through closed loop systems comprising of both an Input and an Output. The agenda for 
  Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) research have been to simultaneously provide the two, modeling sensations 
  recognizable by our Sensory System. Recent pursuits focus on devices that augment visual and auditory faculties. 
  The hand, however, a part of the body that allows rich sensations and expressions to be articulated, deserve closer 
  examination. We have developed "Unlimited Hand", a wearable device granting a human hand access to virtual dimensions. 
  The device reads hand movements with a hybrid set of motion sensors while triggering hand motions by exerting 
  Electric Muscle Stimuli on the wearer's forearm. This simultaneous exchange initiates a closed loop between human 
  hand and computer. In this meeting, we will look into how this device is capable of providing new tactile experiences 
  in multiple fields of applications.


bio: |
  Emi Tamaki is an Assistant Professor at Waseda University and the Co-Founder and Chief Researcher of H2L, Inc.

  She is aiming to research and popularize VR(Virtual Reality) and AR(Augmented Reality) in the transmission of the 
  tactile feeling and other sensations between computers and humans.

  In 2010, Tamaki developed PossessedHand, a device to control human finger movements by a computer and wearable 
  electrodes for experiencing the VR world. PossessedHand has drawn the attention of many scientific societies and has 
  appeared on CNN and ABC TV. PossessedHand was also selected as one of Time magazine's Best 50 Inventions. Tamaki 
  received a Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo Graduate School in 2011. In the same year, she received the University 
  of Tokyo President's Award for Students and was the valedictorian of her class. In 2012, she started up a company, 
  H2L, Inc. about tactile feeling with Ken Iwasaki and Tomy Kamada. In 2013, Tamaki resumed research activities at 
  Waseda University. She was recently awarded the Woman of the Year Runner-up Prize in the Nikkei Woman. From 2013 she 
  is working on a new device, UnlimitedHand that is the world's first haptic controller in the VR game world. 
  UnlimitedHand allows the user to touch and feel the virtual objects. UnlimitedHand was launched at September, 2015 at 
  TechCrunch SF 2015. On KickStarter, the crowd-founding of UnlimitedHand reached their goal in just 22 hours.
