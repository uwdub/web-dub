title:      "Contextual Canaries: Addressing Information Asymmetry and Navigating Design with Unwritten Stories"

location:   "CSE2/Gates 401 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  As smartphones and other personal devices have become ubiquitous, we have made some 
  assumptions as researchers about the ownership of devices,  their usage, and how these
  patterns influence how we understand device affordances,  and information privacy 
  and security. In this talk, I will share field experiences that have led us to 
  revisit some of the settled maxims regarding shared devices, multiple device use, 
  and even multiple SIM usage. This opens the space to discuss device ownership 
  complexities, financial impetus, and other externalities that complicate our 
  understanding of user risks.  I will showcase how these risks are represented through
  examples of how technology-related terms and conditions documents are followed, how
  they reveal malicious compliance,  how they are useful to measure ignorance of their
  existence, and how they are breached--highlighting exploitation disparities where 
  marginalized users are often the ones who face the brunt of these actions. The 
  subsequent choices users make to mitigate their risks and recover from harm will 
  also touch on the intricacies of how marginalized users leverage their wisdom to 
  engage with technology and how their knowledge can provide important guidance on 
  how we can audit current technology and envision future technologies, together 
  with the design implications and emerging ethical tensions.

  Lindah Kotut is an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington’s Information 
  School. Dr. Kotut’s research is at the intersection of human computer interaction, 
  indigenous Knowledge and cybersecurity. She studies how people tell stories both online
  and offline, and the role that technology plays in the telling: especially of communities 
  that do not have equitable access to storytelling tools and technology. Dr. Kotut seeks 
  to highlight how learning from these underrepresented stories can inform the design of 
  tools to amplify other communities to tell their own stories offline and online, and, 
  more broadly, in providing spaces to query how these techniques offer key opportunities
  to understand other emerging and growing areas in computer science including ethics, 
  privacy, (cyber)security and fairness and accountability in algorithm design.
