title:      "Slow Interaction Design"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract:   |
  The convergence of social, cloud and mobile computing has created a world in which people generate, access, manipulate, and share personal digital data at larger scales and faster rates than ever before. From digital photo albums to online music streaming services, these new technologies have enabled people to create vast archives of virtual possessions that capture their life experiences. While these technological trends have created many opportunities, they also raise complex questions for the HCI community as we critically look to the future and consider their longer-term implications. As archives continue to grow, how will people live with their virtual possessions in ways that support their evolving practices, values, and understandings of self? How might peopleâ€™s relations to digital data and the technologies that manifest them change over time? What kinds of qualities should designers consider in crafting a longer-term place for computational things in everyday life? In this talk I will draw on examples from my research to motivate these questions as a crucial research space for the HCI community. I will then give an overview of my recent and ongoing research-through-design projects themed around the concept of slow interaction design that demonstrate productive ways of grappling with these complex and emerging questions.
