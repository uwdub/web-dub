title:      "Understanding and Supporting Communication Across Linguistic Boundaries"

location:   "HUB 332"

abstract: |
  Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools and social media potentially allow people to interact fluidly across 
  national, cultural and linguistic boundaries in ways that would have been difficult if not impossible in the past. 
  To date, however, however, much of this potential fails to be realized. A single individual is unlikely to be 
  fluent in a wide array of languages. The use of a lingua franca such as English permits a degree of interaction 
  with speakers of other native languages, but it can have negative effects on non-native speakers. Advances in 
  machine translation (MT) and other technologies could allow people to communicate with one another in their native 
  language, but translation errors can create sizeable misunderstandings when MT is used in conversational settings.  

  In a series of studies, my students and I have been exploring the problem space of inter-lingual communication, 
  with the goals of better understanding the challenges of interaction across language boundaries and of informing 
  the design of new tools to support this interaction.  I will first describe two interview studies exploring how the 
  need to use a non-native language affects communication and coordination in both formal and informal settings. I 
  will then describe several tools we have developed to make MT more usable in everyday conversation and present the 
  results of lab studies evaluating these tools.  Taken together, these studies help help advance the area of 
  inter-lingual computer-mediated communication.
