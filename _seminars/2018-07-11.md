title:      "Understanding the Workplace Experience Through Sensor Tracking of Behavior"

location:   "HUB 332"

abstract: |
  Understanding the workplace experience is important in order to develop solutions to improve health, mood, and performance, and reduce stress. However, until recently, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral measurements of the workplace experience have been constrained by methodologies based on infrequent measurements or self-reports. The ongoing revolution in the development of sensor technologies is enabling new ways to measure human behavior in situ with precision. With a mixed-methods approach using sensors, along with EMA, computer logging, and repeated surveys, I will present a framework for measuring different attentional states. I will present results showing how attention focus, stress and affect are impacted by digital media use, and how attention focus varies over the workday. This research shows that there are consequences of having access to so many digital information sources: they compete for people's attention, leading to continual attention switching among different information streams and devices. I will discuss the value and challenges of using sensor measures in situ to study and design for improved digital media use.
