title:      "Smart toys and parenting with Alexa: how to promote mental health with digital technologies?"

location:   "CSE2 G10"

abstract: |
  Can digital technologies deliver prevention interventions  — i.e promote psychological 
  resilience of those at risk and lower the occurrence of mental illness later in life? 
  While this is not a question commonly asked within HCI so far, research in Prevention 
  Science suggests that such programs could have strong impacts on life outcomes, 
  particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Traditional interventions are 
  however substantially limited in scope and cost-effectiveness by relying on delivery 
  techniques and intervention mechanisms that have been around since the 60s: teaching 
  experiential skills in class or a workshop, by a trained human. By way of analogy, 
  this is similar to delivering skiing lessons indoors through role-play and video, 
  and then expecting learners to be able to ski right away with no additional support.

  In this talk, I will draw on our work across a range of contexts (emotion-regulation, 
  conflict resolution, parenting) to offer an alternative approach based on ‘situating’ 
  the intervention support and learning directly into everyday moments where the targeted 
  skills are needed. I will ground these conceptual arguments in the findings from our 
  ‘Smart Toy’ project, where an emotion regulation intervention is delivered to children 
  through a technology-enabled plush toy; a prototype of which is currently taken to 
  production by Committee for Children (Seattle-based non-profit developers of a social-
  emotional program used in 30% of US schools, see more here: <https://cfchildren.org/>). 
  This research illustrates the potential of emerging technologies---and careful socio-
  technical design--- to re-imagine how prevention interventions are designed, delivered, 
  and evaluated.
