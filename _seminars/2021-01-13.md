title:      "Designing to Empower Marginalized Communities through Social Technology"

location:   "TBD"

abstract: |
  Technology frequently marginalizes people from underrepresented and vulnerable groups; more and more, we’re learning how social media platforms, AI systems, machine learning algorithms, video games, etc., can enact, amplify, or perpetuate discrimination based on dimensions of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality. In this talk, I will share several studies within a project that exemplify the methods I use for gathering personal narratives of marginalization and for developing and evaluating empowering games and social technologies. The CARE (coping after racist experiences) project uses interactive narratives to study how people experience, cope with, and seek support for interpersonal racism such as racist microaggressions. I will share qualitative interviews, user testing, and participatory design work that brings people from marginalized backgrounds to the table in designing for a more empowered future. I will end by proposing several promising avenues for future work that extends my work adapting critical race theory to HCI and games research.
