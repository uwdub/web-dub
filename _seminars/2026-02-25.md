title:      "Remote Diagnostics and Patient Monitoring Technologies for Ubiquitous Healthcare"

location:   "Kane 225 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  Nearly half of the global population and 35% of the US population report poor access to healthcare, while estimates suggest over 90% of the population has access to smartphones.  The overarching goal of the Uncommon Sense Lab is to extend the reach of healthcare by leveraging existing infrastructure to reach patients in rural areas or those who cannot otherwise access healthcare. In this talk, Dr. Adams will present his Lab’s work on novel sensing systems for continuous patient monitoring and remote diagnostics.

bio: |
  Dr. Adams’ research focuses on designing, fabricating, and implementing new ubiquitous and wearable sensing systems.  In particular, he can develop systems that enable remote monitoring and diagnostics for more pervasive healthcare. Alex leverages sensing, signal processing, and fabrication techniques to design, deploy, and evaluate novel sensing technologies. 

  Originally a musician, Alex became fascinated by how he could capture and manipulate sounds through analog hardware and digital signal processing, which led him back to his hometown (Concord, NC).  He completed his BS at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2014 and his Ph.D. at Cornell University in 2021 (advised by Professor Tanzeem Choudhury).  Alex then became the resident Research Scientist for the Precision Behavioral Health Initiative at Cornell Tech (NYC) until the fall of 2022, when he joined the School of Interactive Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  He is currently a faculty member in HCI, Robotics, and human-centered computing with affiliations in the Institute of People and Technology and the Institute of Bioengineering and Bioscience.  As Director of the Uncommon Sense Labs, Dr. Adams explores how we can meet people where they are with a novel sensing system that enables lab-quality health assessments for chronic disease, maternal/fetal health, substance use disorder, and chronic pain.
