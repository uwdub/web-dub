title:      "Beyond Inclusion: Confronting Bias in Human Centered Design Before the Robots Take Over"

location:   "Sieg 233"

abstract: |
  Design is a discipline filled with Philosopher Kings, holders of arcane knowledge who believe we're uniquely
  qualified to dazzle the masses stuck in Plato's cave. We all live in the designed world, and both our
  moment-to-moment experiences and our most personal conceptions of the self are shaped by the design
  expression of others; as designers we strive to continuously interrogate our processes and motives to
  ensure they include rather than exclude, uplift rather than denigrate, and expand personal agency rather
  than constrain it. Human-centered design supports our work by offering a methodological framework to enhance
  empathy and bridge gaps between designers and consumers, but this still results in products and services filled
  with translation errors and missed opportunities. Most designers ultimately still believe we're Philosopher Kings
  (even if we're loathe to admit it), and we still typically live a world away from the personas we so diligently
  create. This discussion explores the need to turn a human-centered lens upon ourselves, and asks that we reject
  the designer as Philosopher King model as we rush into a virtual world where our experience of reality is even
  more comprehensively provided by someone else.

  Jason Pace is the Executive Director of the University of Washington Bothellâ€™s Digital Future Lab
  (<http://digitalfuturelab.com/>),
  an interactive media research and commercial game development studio focused on transforming how the
  technology industry approaches design and diversity. Pace started the lab after spending 16 years at
  Microsoft leading user experience and product development teams on a number of Microsoft's consumer
  products, and his work in the DFL explores how radically diverse teams (teams that intentionally seek
  to maximize individual differences across a broad spectrum of backgrounds) can lead to unexpected insights,
  new directions in product development, and increased efficiency. The lab challenges conventional wisdom
  about pedigree and notions of "culture fit", bringing undergraduate students together from across majors
  and schools to create high-performance creative teams engaged in both commercial product development and
  design research.
