title:      "Bricks, Walls, and Arches: In Pursuit of Deeper Human-Computer Symbioses"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract: |
  I will share reflections on directions with leveraging advances in machine intelligence to develop systems that enable new forms of competent and fluid human-computer collaboration. I will describe key building blocks and larger architectures that harness machine perception, learning, and inference. Then, I will describe the composition of integrative solutions that draw upon multiple competencies and that operate over extended periods of time.  Explorations of such integrative machine intelligence frame research on the coordination of multiple components for sensing and reasoning to create higher-level abstractions, functionalities, and architectures in support of human-computer collaboration and deeper symbioses.
