title:      "Social Computing Participation Gaps as Pipelines: Who Is Missing from Your Community and Why That Matters"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract:   |
  The impact of many social computing systems and peer production communities depends on their openness and the inclusion of many contributors. However, extreme participation gaps emerge on every platform and, in many cases, follow familiar patterns of social inequality, with less privileged individuals less likely to participate. These digital inequalities have huge negative impacts, so how should social computing designers and researchers respond? I argue that we have to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of and barriers to participation. Data from recent survey research analyzing participation gaps on Wikipedia illustrates what this can look like. The gender gap among active Wikipedia editors has attracted widespread attention and inspired thoughtful initiatives to change the culture of the community and mobilize female contributors. However, it turns out that a number of factors including education, Internet use skills, as well as gender help explain who even engages in the behaviors or possesses the knowledge necessary to edit in the first place. Analyzing digital inequality as the product of a pipeline of participation reveals design opportunities and challenges with the potential for especially high impact.
