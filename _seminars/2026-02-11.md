title:      "Quick to Answer, Slow to Abstain: Managing Uncertainty in Scientific and Consumer Health QA"

location:   "Kane 225 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  Large language models are increasingly used in interactive question-answering systems for finding scientific and consumer health information. Yet in many real-world cases, a clear answer may not exist. In this talk, I examine cases where models lack sufficient knowledge to answer—and why they often do anyway. Drawing on examples from consumer health QA, I show how models struggle when evidence is missing or poorly matched to the question, and how choices such as answer formats or prompt framing can induce overconfidence. This is supported by our empirical findings characterizing LLM refusal behavior in science and medical QA, showing that refusal performance varies substantially by question type and the contextual information that is provided or is available to the model. Unfortunately, refusal is rarely represented explicitly in most existing benchmarks and rarely assessed alongside its interactional outcomes: how users act upon refusal and/or uncertainty in model responses. Based on our prior work in meta-evaluation and user-centered studies of AI-mediated plain language communication, I close with a discussion of how to address this evaluation gap.
