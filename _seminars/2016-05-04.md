title:      "Printing Pictures in 3D"

location:   "HUB 332"

abstract: |
  The Tactile Picture Book Project (TPBP) is a research endeavor that utilizes 3D printing as a new media platform
  for designing, developing, and distributing information in a tangible format. The mission of TPBP is to give children
  with visual impairments access to a lot more pictures they can "see" by touch and feel. To date, the TPBP team has
  made 3D adaptations for several children's book classics such as Goodnight Moon, Harold and the Purple Crayon,
  The Very Hungry Caterpillar, Dear Zoo, and Noah's Ark. In this talk, Yeh will demonstrate examples of 3D pictures,
  discuss the technical challenges encountered in creating these pictures, and share the many valuable lessons learned
  through the process. In addition, Yeh will present CraftML, a new 3D modeling markup language designed to mimic common
  web technologies including HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. CraftML allows web designers without prior 3D modeling
  experience to easily bring their creative talents and design skills to the domain of 3D modeling. The TPBP is
  supported by a research grant from the National Science Foundation and has appeared in several news outlets such
  as 9News, Newsweek, DailyCamera, DailyMail, New Scientist, Science Daily, and NPR.
