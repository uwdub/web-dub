title:      "Filling the Pipeline: Design & Engineering Workshops for K-12 Outreach"

location:   "HUB 340"

  For the past few years, HCDE has been using a design activity known as a charette as a way to introduce students to the     user-centered design (UCD) process.  We have run participatory workshops with students at all levels, from elementary       school to graduate programs. They have been led by volunteer teams of UW students, who serve as facilitators and mentors.   These outreach workshops have been especially successful in introducing young students to engineering, design, and STE(A)M   disciplines, and in inspiring them to consider educational and career paths in these fields. We recently participated in     the UW’s Alternative Spring Break (ASB) program, part of the Pipeline Project K-12 outreach efforts. HCDE students spent a   week at Markishtum Middle School in Neah Bay, Washington, leading a “Design Thinking” workshop. The Neah Bay students       researched, designed, and prototyped mobile applications in domains relevant to their culture. This was Pipeline’s first     engineering-oriented ASB program. In this talk, I will report on our experiences using the UCD charette in a variety of K-   12 outreach efforts, with a special look at the ASB experience in Neah Bay.
