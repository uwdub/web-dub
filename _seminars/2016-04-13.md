title:      "When Anyone Can Say Anything: Credibility, Censorship, and Moderation in Social Media"

location:   "HUB 332"

abstract: |
  Perhaps the defining attribute of social media is that anyone anywhere can say anything. This is often wonderful. 
  Then again: *anyone anywhere* can say *anything*. In this talk, I will concentrate on two lines of inquiry: 
  1) What if people say things that aren't true?; 2) What if people say things their government doesn't like? 
  First, I will discuss the development and analysis of a large-scale, systematic credibility corpus, called CREDBANK. 
  With CREDBANK's 66M tweets nested in 1,377 real-world events, we have found temporal and linguistic regularities 
  differentiating credible and non-credible information on Twitter. Second, I will discuss a prototype linguistic algorithm we
  built to circumvent censorship on Chinese social media. Taking advantage of Mandarin's natural homophones, we transformed
  previously-censored posts to stay on Sina Weibo three times longer and create millions of false positives for censors--while
  remaining human-interpretable. Finally, I will close the talk with a preview of a new line of work emerging from a different
  question: What if people say horrible things to each other? Here, we are working on machine learning-based interventions to help
  moderate online spaces.
