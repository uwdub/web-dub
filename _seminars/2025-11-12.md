title:      "Growing up with AI: Reciprocal Learning between Children and AI"

location:   "Kane 225 - Hybrid via Zoom"

abstract: |
  AI is not only reshaping the career landscape – with an estimated 170 million new jobs to be created in the next five years – but more prominently, emerges as a powerful tool for the way we think and learn in nearly every aspect of life. Children are arguably among the most vulnerable to its impact, as they navigate through a critical developmental stage for learning how to learn. The tandem of preparing children for an increasingly AI-driven society and avoiding the risk of bypassing the cognitive efforts essential for developing lifelong learning skills, presents intriguing challenges and opportunities for envisioning future learning technologies.

  In this talk, I want to provide a common ground for exploring the interplay between AI and learning, drawing on insights from two ongoing projects. The first project focuses on K-12 AI literacy, building embodied learning technologies using Augmented Reality and Tangible User Interface to demystify AI and promote critical thinking of its ethical implications. The second project explores AI-mediated ASL communication to avoid language deprivation for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) children, by supporting hearing parents to simultaneously learn and offer sign language within weeks of diagnosis. I’d like to engage the audience to rethink the reciprocal relationship between AI for learning and learning AI, and how to help the next generation to become strong thinkers and lifelong learners - benefiting from rather than being deprived by AI.

  Dr. Zhen Bai is an Assistant Professor co-leading the ROCHCI research group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Rochester. She completed her PhD degree in Computer Science from University of Cambridge and was a post-doctoral fellow at CMU HCII and LTI before joining Rochester. Dr. Bai’s research focuses on creating embodied and intelligent user interfaces to foster socio-emotional (e.g., imagination, social understanding, curiosity, communication) and STEM learning (e.g., AI literacy, scientific inquiry) for children with diverse backgrounds (e.g., autism, deaf and hard of hearing). She is the recipient of the NSF CAREER award, Google Inclusion Research Award, and the Asaro Biggar family fellowship.
