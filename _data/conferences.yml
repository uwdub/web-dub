#
# conference_series:
#   id_avi:
#     longname: Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces
#     shortname: AVI
#
# ID should be formatted id_{}:
#   - shortname lowercased removing any of ' ', '.', or '/'
#
# Alternative, a series may have a special track designation:

# conference_series:
#   id_aaai_nectar:
#     longname: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Nectar Track
#     shortname: AAAI
#     slug: nectar
#
# ID should be formatted id_{}_{}
#   - series short name as above
#   - slug for the track
#
# The conference adds a year:
#
# id_conference_avi2014:
#   series: id_avi
#   year: 2014
#
# ID should be formatted id_conference_{}{}:
#   - series short name as above

# Alternative, the short name and year should be kept together if there is a slug:
#
# id_conference_aaai2008_nectar:
#   series: id_aaai_nectar
#   year: 2008
#
# ID should be formatted id_conference_{}{}_{}:
