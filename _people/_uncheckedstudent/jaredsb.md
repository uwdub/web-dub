old-dub-bio: I am a PhD at the iSchool, and my adviser is <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jkientz/">Julie
  Kientz</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/chilllab/node/1">CHiLL
  Lab</a>.  My research interests are ubiquitous and affective computing. In particular,
  I'm interested in how these technologies can be leveraged to encourage emotional
  health. I am currently working on a project called<a href="http://dub.washington.edu/projects/moodmusic/">
  MoodMusic</a>. Our current work focuses on determining a group's "mood" and selecting
  appropriate music for the group members given their current mood.
