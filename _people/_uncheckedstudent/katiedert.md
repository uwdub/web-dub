  \ Exploring the Relationship between Meditation, Values, and Technology</b><br></h2>\r\
  \nLead Researcher: Katie Derthick, PhD Candidate, 770-891-seven four eight three,\
  \ derthick at uw dot edu<br>\r\nDepartment of Human Centered Design & Engineering<br>\r\
  \nNote: Confidentiality cannot be guaranteed for communication sent via the web\r\
  \n<br></br>\r\nYou are being asked to participate in a research study that explores\
  \ the relationship between meditation values, meditation practices, and technology\
  \ use.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<b>Procedures: Observation and Interviews</b>\r\n<br>\r\n\
  The research procedures involve allowing the lead researcher to observe events at\
  \ this location, including meditation sessions, lessons, small groups, and other\
  \ special events. The researcher will collect artifacts and quotes during observation.\
  \ If applicable, online communication that is publicly visible will also be observed\
  \ and statements and posted links will be collected. When observing meditation sessions,\
  \ the researcher will be focusing on how guidance is provided and what objects (ex:\
  \ cushions) are used, rather than any individual\u2019s personal behavior. This\
  \ research takes the form of ethnography, with \u201Cparticipation observation\u201D\
  \ on the part of the researcher. In other words, the researcher will be participating\
  \ in the same events she observes. \r\n<br></br>\r\nDuring the observations the\
  \ lead researcher will not interrupt your practice or engage you with questions.\
  \ The researcher will record the field site name, but not individual identifiers\
  \ during observation. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThe research procedures will also involve\
  \ audio-recorded interviews with members of the community. During the interviews,\
  \ the lead researcher will ask about your meditation practice as well as general\
  \ technology use; you may decline to answer any questions the researcher may ask.\
  \ Interviews will preferably take place in person, in a mutually agreeable location,\
  \ though they may be conducted remotely if necessary. If the interview takes place\
  \ remotely, the interviewer will call you so the call will cost you nothing, or\
  \ we can use Skype voice chat or VoIP. Interviews will last no more than an hour\
  \ and a half, with the potential for a follow-up interview of no more than an hour\
  \ and a half at a later time (which you may opt out of). There is a demographics\
  \ survey at the end of the interview; all questions are optional.\r\n<br></br>\r\
  \n<b>Risks and Benefits</b>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only foreseeable discomfort associated\
  \ with the study is the invasion of your privacy. There are no direct benefits from\
  \ participation in the study. However, this research will contribute to a more sophisticated\
  \ understanding of how individuals with meditation practices and related values\
  \ make decisions about technology use, which will contribute to discourse on technology\
  \ in everyday life. \r\n<br></br>\r\n<b>Participation is Voluntary and Your Privacy\
  \ is Important</b>\r\n<br>\r\nParticipation in this study is voluntary. There is\
  \ no cost to you for participating. You may refuse to participate or discontinue\
  \ your involvement at any time without penalty; to do so, approach the lead researcher\
  \ in person, send her a Facebook message, or email her at derthick@uw.edu and request\
  \ not to be observed. You may choose to skip a question or a study procedure. You\
  \ will not be paid for your participation in this research. All research data collected\
  \ will be stored securely and confidentially in a locked room or on a secure server.\
  \ Identifiable information (email addresses and names) linked to audio recordings\
  \ will be kept only for interviewees until the study is complete, in case a follow-up\
  \ interview is needed. I will retain this information for 1 year after the conclusion\
  \ of the study, after which time I will destroy all links between pseudonyms and\
  \ direct identifiers. Audio recordings will be retained for four years after study\
  \ completion, after which time they will be destroyed. Participant names will not\
  \ be published.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<b>How to Get your Questions Answered</b>\r\n<br>\r\
  \nIf you have any questions, you may ask them now or at any time during the study.\
  \ If you have questions later on about the research you can ask the lead researcher\
  \ listed above. You may also email if you are interested in participating or learning\
  \ more. If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you can call\
  \ the University of Washington Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-zero zero nine\
  \ eight."
