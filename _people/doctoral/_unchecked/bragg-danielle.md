old-dub-bio: I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of
  Washington advised by James Fogarty. My research interests lie at the intersection
  of Human-Computer Interaction, Visualization, and Machine Learning. My past research
  projects have included computer music system design and construction, network protocol
  design and evaluation, and data visualization projects. I also hold a BA in Applied
  Mathematics from Harvard University.
