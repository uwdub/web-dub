old-dub-bio: "<p>\r\nI am currently a PhD student in <a href='http://www.hcde.washington.edu/'\
  \ target='_blank'>Human-Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE)</a> at University\
  \ of Washington. As a member of <a href='http://depts.washington.edu/sccl/' target='_blank'>Scientific\
  \ Collaboration and Creativity Lab (SCCL)</a>, I work with <a href='http://faculty.washington.edu/aragon/'\
  \ target='_blank'>Prof. Cecilia Aragon</a>. I am also a member of the <a href='http://dub.washington.edu/'\
  \ target='_blank'> Design-Use-Build (DUB) group</a>. I received my B.S. degree in\
  \ <a href='http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?lang=en' target='_blank'>Computer\
  \ Science and Information Engineering</a> with a minor in <a href='http://140.112.62.7/act4-e.php'\
  \ target='_blank'>Psychology</a> from <a href='http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/' target='_blank'>National\
  \ Taiwan University</a> in 2013, where I worked with <a href='http://mll.csie.ntu.edu.tw/hchu.php'\
  \ target='_blank'>Prof. Hao-Hua Chu</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy research is focused\
  \ on human-computer interaction. I am interested in developing visualization tools\
  \ to help people better understand data and technologies to support collaboration.\
  \ I am now working on building tools to analyze affect in text-based communication,\
  \ such as online chat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI grew up in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei'\
  \ target='_blank'>Taipei, Taiwan</a>. It is a city having super convenient <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei#Transportation'\
  \ target='_blank'>public transportation systems</a>, bike-friendly streets, and\
  \ countless taxies. This means you can live without having a car. In addition, you\
  \ can find food anytime anywhere in Taipei. We have many great <a href='http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1547'\
  \ target='_blank'>night markets</a>, various restaurants, and super convenient convenience\
  \ stores. Taipei is also famous for its <a href='http://fs.weatherspark.com.s3.amazonaws.com/production/reports/year/000/033/158/47ccbfb4/probability_of_precipitation_at_some_point_in_the_day_percent_pct.png'\
  \ target='_blank'>rainy weather</a> - this is one of the reasons why I chose Seattle.\
