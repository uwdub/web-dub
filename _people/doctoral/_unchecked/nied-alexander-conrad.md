old-dub-bio: "I'm a computer scientist with a background in cognitive science. I am\
  \ in my first year of my PhD program at University of Washington: Computer Science\
  \ and Engineering, in which I work in the Human Computer Interaction lab. Previously,\
  \ I worked at Massachusetts General Hospital in the Neuropsychology Laboratory and\
  \ got my bachelors degree in CS at Boston University.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nI imagine\
  \ a day in which we will be able to enter each other's minds and feel and experience\
  \ all of the emotions and thoughts we have. We are already on our way; technology\
  \ has the power to transform our relationships and bring us together. With the aim\
  \ to contribute to that field, I have worked in human data analysis, user interfaces,\
  \ and linguistic neuroscience. Part of this endeavor is to make computer interfaces\
  \ that utilize our cognitive abilities better. For that, I am working on an interface\
  \ reinterpreting program called Prefab with James Fogarty and Morgan Dixon. Ultimately,\
  \ I want to work on programs that work between people and improve our communication\
  \ with each other.\r\n"
