  >Stanford University</a>, working with <a href=\"http://jheer.org/\">Jeff Heer</a>\
  \ and the UW <a href=\"http://idl.cs.washington.edu/\">Interactive Data Lab</a>.\
  \ My research seeks to reduce the burden of design for less technical &amp; non-expert\
  \ audiences, with a focus on visualization and web design. I also serve as an advisor\
  \ to <a href=\"http://apropose.com/\">Apropose, Inc.</a>, a Bay Area startup I co-founded\
  \ to build data-driven web design tools.\r\n"
