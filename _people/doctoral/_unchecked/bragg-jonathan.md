old-dub-bio: I am a second-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">Computer
  Science &amp; Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University
  of Washington</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Dan
  Weld</a> and <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam">Mausam</a>. My primary
  research interests are in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human-computer
  interaction. In particular, I am interested in using crowdsourcing systems to solve
  important problems, and making these systems more broadly useful and scalable with
  techniques from optimization and decision theory.
