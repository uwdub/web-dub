old-dub-bio: "<p>I am a first-year PhD student and my research area of interest is\
  \ the intersection between culture and technology. In the future, I hope to explore\
  \ new media design on a global scale and, specifically how user research methods\
  \ apply. This is closely connected with issues of technology adoption and use with\
  \ respect to local needs and requirements.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Currently, I am working\
  \ with Prof. Beth Kolko in investigating how technology skills are acquired through\
  \ non instrumental uses like gaming and social networking. This research is part\
  \ of a larger study on the impact of public access to ICTs on a global scale.</p>\r\
