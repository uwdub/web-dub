old-dub-bio: "I am a Ph.D. student at the Information School at the University of\
  \ Washington. \r\n\r\nMy research area is software engineering practices. My research\
  \ interests are in incorporating user experiences into software engineering practices.\
  \ The research project I am currently involved in looks at how software development\
  \ teams make bug triage decisions:\r\n\r\n</i>We\u2019ve all experienced software\
  \ failures: we\u2019re working on a document and the processor crashes, we\u2019\
  re watching a video online and the browser freezes. How do software development\
  \ teams decide which failures experienced by users to fix? </i>\r\n\r\n"
