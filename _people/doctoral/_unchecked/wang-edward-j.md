old-dub-bio: I am a first year PhD student in the Electrical Engineering department
  at the University of Washington advised by Shwetak Patel. My research focus is on
  leveraging existing computing infrastructure to create novel sensing techniques
  for biosignals. In particular, I am interested in creating more seamless monitoring
  of the human health in order to provide early detection of diseases.
