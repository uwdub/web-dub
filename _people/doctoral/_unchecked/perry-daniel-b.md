  > Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering</a> at the University of Washington. My\
  \ research focuses on the intersection of gaming with scientific and engineering\
  \ collaborations.  I\u2019m particularly interested in ways that gaming environments\
  \ can be utilized for knowledge work, citizen science, and engineering design. I\u2019\
  m a researcher in the <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/sccl/\">Scientific Collaboration\
  \ and Creativity Lab</a>, and I\u2019ve conducted previous research on games and\
