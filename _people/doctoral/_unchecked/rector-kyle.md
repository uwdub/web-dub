old-dub-bio: I am a third year PhD student in <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">Computer
  Science and Engineering</a> at the University of Washington, and my advisors are
  <a href="http://www.juliekientz.com/">Julie Kientz</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ladner/">Richard
  Ladner</a>.  I am passionate about a11y (accessibility), and I enjoy designing and
  building eyes-free exercise technologies. My goal is to reduce the gap between people
  who are blind or low-vision and independent exercise.
