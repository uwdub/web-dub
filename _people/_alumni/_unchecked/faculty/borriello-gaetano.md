old-dub-bio: "Gaetano Borriello, Professor, has a BS in EE from the Polytechnic Institute\
  \ of New York (1979), an MS in EE from Stanford University (1981), and a PhD in\
  \ CS from the Unversity of California at Berkeley (1988). He was a member of the\
  \ research staff at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center from 1980-87. He joined\
  \ the Department in 1988.\r\n\r\nGaetano Borriello is known primarily for his work\
  \ in automatic synthesis of digital circuits, reconfigurable hardware, and embedded\
  \ systems development tools. He was a founder of Consystant Design Technologies\
  \ in 1999.  From 2000-2003, Borriello was PI for the Portolano Expedition, a DARPA-sponsored\
  \ investigation on invisible computing. He was on partial leave from 2001 to 2003\
  \ to found and direct Intel Research Seattle, a laboratory which has emerged as\
  \ one of the premiere organizations engaged in ubiquitous computing research. \r\
  \n\r\nThe focus of Borriello's research interests are in location-based systems,\
  \ sensor-based inferencing, and tagging objects with passive and active tags. Most\
  \ recently he is focusing on the use of mobile devices for data collection in public\
  \ health applications in the developing world.  Borriello has served as program\
  \ chair of numerous conferences and workshops. His most recent community activities\
  \ include being program chair for the 4th International Conference on Ubiquitous\
  \ Computing (Ubicomp02), serving on the editorial board of IEEE Pervasive Computing\
  \ magazine, contributing to a study, called \"Embedded, Everywhere\", commissioned\
  \ by the Computer Science Technology Board of the National Research Council on Networked\
  \ Systems of Embedded Computers. \r\n"
