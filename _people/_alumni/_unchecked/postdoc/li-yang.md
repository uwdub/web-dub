old-dub-bio: "<p>I am a Research Associate in the <A href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/\"\
  >Department of Computer Science and Engineering</A>, working with <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/landay\"\
  >James Landay</a>. \r\n                                    I earned a Ph.D. degree\
  \ in Computer Science from the <a href=\"http://english.cas.ac.cn/Eng2003/page/home.asp\"\
  >Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, \r\n                        and then did my postdoctoral\
  \ research in <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/\">EECS</a> at the <a href=\"\
  http://www.berkeley.edu/\">University of California at Berkeley</a>.           \
  \              <p />                        \r\n                        I am broadly\
  \ interested in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Software Engineering,\
  \ especially  \r\n                        user interface prototyping tools, pen-based\
  \ user interfaces, ubiquitous computing and programming by demonstration. My current\
  \ research focus is on <b>design tools for ubiquitous computing applications</b>.\
  \ In particular, I am using an <b>activity-based approach</b> that is grounded in\
  \ existing \r\n                        ubicomp design pratice as well as social\
  \ psychological theories to: \r\n                        <ul>\r\n              \
  \          <li>streamline a ubicomp design process including field research, analysis,\
  \ prototyping, and testing,</li>\r\n                        <li>and ground interaction\
  \ design/computing in both situational factors and the persistent structures of\
  \ human activity.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    \
  \    I designed and built <a href=\"http://dub.washington.edu/activitydesigner\"\
  >ActivityDesigner</a>, a system for activity-based ubicomp prototyping."
