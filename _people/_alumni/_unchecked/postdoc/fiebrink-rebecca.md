old-dub-bio: "I am a postdoc in CSE working with James Fogarty, as well as folks from\
  \ Microsoft Research. I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at Princeton\
  \ University, and I will return to Princeton in autumn 2011 as an assistant professor.\
  \ My dissertation work focused on applying interactive machine learning to music\
  \ composition and performance. My research interests span music information retrieval,\
  \ computer music performance technologies and practices, the design of new hardware\
  \ and software musical interfaces, creative human-computer interaction, and end-user\
  \ interactive machine learning.\r\n"
