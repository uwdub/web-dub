old-dub-bio: "Graduated in 2010 from the <a href=\"http://www.ischool.washington.edu/\"\
  >Information School</a> with a B.S. in Informatics with an official concentration\
  \ in Human-Computer Interaction. As an undergraduate I was a member of the <a href=\"\
  http://depts.washington.edu/aimgroup/\">AIM Research Group</a> under Professor <a\
  \ href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/\">Jacob O. Wobbrock</a>. Worked\
  \ on the <a href=\"http://dub.washington.edu/pubs/239\">Enhanced Area Cursors</a>\
  \ project as a National Science Foundation REU Scholar.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
  For my Informatics capstone project I developed a <a href=\"http://www.onehandkeyboard.org/\"\
  >One-Hand Keyboard Layout</a> based on two-hand muscle memory. The <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/one-hand-keyboard/id465275525?mt=12\"\
  >one-hand typing software</a> makes it easy for any former two-hand typist to type\
  \ with one hand. Demo available on the <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/one-hand-keyboard-practice/id501185004?mt=12\"\
  >Mac App Store</a>."
