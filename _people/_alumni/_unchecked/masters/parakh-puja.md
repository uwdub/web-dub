old-dub-bio: I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, and received degrees in Behavioral
  Psychology and Computer Information Systems.  As a Master's student in Human Centered
  Design & Engineering at the University of Washington, specializing in User Centered
  Design, I enjoy being in touch with others who are interested in the latest trends
  of information design and user experience.  Outside of the UX world, I also work
  as a portrait/concert photographer.
