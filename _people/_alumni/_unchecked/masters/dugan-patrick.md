old-dub-bio: "Hi! My name is Patrick Dugan and I was one of the 30 inaugural members\
  \ of UW's Human Computer Interaction + Design masters program. Before returning\
  \ to grad school I worked at Google in an internal development and data analytics\
  \ role. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br><br>I\u2019m currently working as a member of the\
  \ user experience team at <a href=\"http://www.nextdoor.com\">Nextdoor</a> where\
  \ I'm helping neighbors engage with one another in digital spaces. I'm also a member\
  \ of the <a href=\"http://designerfund.com/bridge/\">Designer Fund Bridge</a> program.\
  \ While a student, my research interests were largely centered around wearable computing\
  \ devices and their potential to influence behavior.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br><br>In\
  \ my free time I love to run, swim, bike, camp, and hike. If you\u2019d like to\
  \ learn more about me, start by checking out my <a href=\"http://www.dailydoog.com/resources/resume/patdugan_resume.pdf\"\
  >resume</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dailydoog.com/portfolio\">portfolio</a>.\r\n\
  \r\n<br><br>I'm also pretty active on several social media platforms, predmoniantly\
  \ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdugan19\">twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.dailydoog.com/\"\
  >blogger</a>, and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+PatDugan/posts\">google+</a>.\
  \ If you're interested in collaborating with me I would love to hear from you."
