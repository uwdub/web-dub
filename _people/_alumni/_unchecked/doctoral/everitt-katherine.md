old-dub-bio: I graduated with my Ph.D. in CSE from the University of Washington, specializing
  in human-computer interaction. My research interests include multimodal interfaces,
  collaborative interaction using tabletop surfaces and large displays, and applications
  for ubiquitous computing. I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from The University
  of California, Berkeley, where I worked with the Group for User Interface Research,
  and a B.Sc. in Computing and Information Science from Queen's University. I now
  work at Microsoft Corp.
