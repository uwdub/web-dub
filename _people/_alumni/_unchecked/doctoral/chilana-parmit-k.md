  \ of Waterloo, specializing in human-computer interaction (HCI) and information\
  \ systems. I received my PhD in Information Science from the University of Washington\
  \ in 2013 where i worked with <a href=\"http://dub.washington.edu/people/andrewko\"\
  >Andrew J. Ko</a> and <a href=\"http://dub.washington.edu/people/wobbrock\">Jacob\
  \ O. Wobbrock </a>. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nFor my dissertation, I invented LemonAid,\
  \ a crowdsourced contextual help system for software applications. I was a recipient\
  \ of Facebook's PhD Fellowship (one of 5 inaugural winners in 2010) and Canada's\
  \ Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Doctoral Award. I have\
  \ previously worked at Princeton University as a programmer and have collaborated\
  \ with researchers at Facebook, Autodesk Research, and Washington's School of Medicine.\
