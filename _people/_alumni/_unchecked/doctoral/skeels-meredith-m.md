old-dub-bio: I am a fourth year PhD student in Biomedical and Health Informatics.
  My areas of focus include personal health informatics, human-computer interaction,
  design methods, qualitative methods, information behavior, information visualization,
  and medical history. The larger goal of my research is to design technology that
  works for people. This often requires understanding the underlying contexts, stakeholders,
  goals, and information needs. My current research is focused on understanding how
  health consumers get, use, manage, and share health information and finding ways
  to bring their voices and experiences into the design process.
