old-dub-bio: "<p>I earned my PhD in <a href=\"http://www.hcde.washington.edu/\">Human\
  \ Centered Design and Engineering</a> in August 2013. I have worked as a Research\
  \ Strategist at the <a href=\"http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:Jtmorgan\"\
  >Wikimedia Foundation</a> since 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I academic work lives at the\
  \ intersection of HCI, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Computer-Mediated\
  \ Communication (CMC). Basically, I study the way people interact and the social\
  \ roles they inhabit when they're working collaboratively on creative tasks online.\
  \ My research was aimed at creating better tools for understanding and supporting\
  \ online deliberation and distributed collaboration, especially for newcomers and\
  \ other downtrodden, maligned, ignored, or otherwise marginalized folks. My full\
  \ CV is available on <a href=\"http://jtmorgan.net/cv\">my personal website</a>.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>My dissertation, <em>Coordinating the Commons: Diversity &amp; Dynamics\
  \ in Open Collaboration</em> is available <a title=\"diss\" href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/morgan_coordinating_the_commons_archival.pdf\"\
  >here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also have an MS in HCDE, and a BA in philosophy and classics\
  \ from St. John's College, with a focus on political philosophy. In my (ever-diminishing)\
  \ spare time, I am a voracious and omnivorous reader and enjoy kayaking, trail running\
  \ and a good game of racquetball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I served as DUB coordinator during\
  \ the 2010-2011 academic year.</p>"
