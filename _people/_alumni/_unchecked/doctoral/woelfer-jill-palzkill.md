  \ of Homeless Young People</a>, a community-based group. Our current project is\
  \ <i>Music is My Life</i> - a show of art work by homeless young people. The art\
  \ work consists of drawings and stories by 129 homeless young people, aged 15-25.\
  \ These drawings and stories are about musical devices which might help homeless\
  \ young people and were created between February-August 2012. Homeless young people\
  \ requested that their drawings and stories be included in a public art show. Since\
  \ May 2013, <i>Music is My Life</i> has appeared in Seattle at Molly\u2019s Caf\xE9\
  \ at the Henry Art Gallery (University of Washington), the Command Print - Art &\
  \ Apparel gallery, and YouthCare. The show is currently in Vancouver, BC where it\
  \ has been on display at Coast Mental Health Resource Center, the University of\
  \ British Columbia, and Vancouver Public Library.<p>"
