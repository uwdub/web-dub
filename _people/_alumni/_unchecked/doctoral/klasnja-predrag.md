old-dub-bio: "<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href=\"http://umsi.umich.edu\"\
  >School of Information</a> at the University of Michigan. Prior to coming to Michigan,\
  \ I was a National Library of Medicine postdoctoral fellow in the division of <a\
  \ href=\"http://www.bhi.washington.edu\">Biomedical and Health Informatics</a>,\
  \ working with <a href=\"http://projects.ischool.washington.edu/wpratt/\">Prof.\
  \ Wanda Pratt</a> and the <a href=\"http://projects.ischool.washington.edu/imed/\"\
  >iMed</a> research group. I received my Ph.D., also advised by Dr. Pratt, from UW's\
  \ <a href=\"http://ischool.uw.edu\">Information School</a>.\r\n<p>\r\nMy research\
  \ is in the areas of Health Informatics, Human Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous\
  \ Computing. In particular, my central research interest is in investigating how\
  \ technology can help patients to manage their health more effectively. Over the\
  \ course of my PhD, I was fortunate to take part is several projects with this aim.\
  \ My dissertation explored the use of mobile phones to support care-related information\
  \ management needs of cancer patients; <i>UbiFit</i> investigated the use of on-body\
  \ sensors and glanceable displays on mobile phones to encourage physical activity;\
  \ and <i>Change of Heart</i> looked at the use of mobile phones and web technologies\
  \ to support heart disease patients in making lifestyle changes needed to reduce\
  \ their cardiac risks.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my current projects, I am exploring how glanceable\
  \ displays can be used as unobtrusive reminders for medication adherence, how mobile\
  \ technology can help individuals manage diabetes, and how we can support provider-patient\
  \ communication during treatment for chronic pain.<p>"
