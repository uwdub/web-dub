old-dub-bio: "Joel Kollin is a PhD student at the University of Washington\u2019s\
  \ Digital Art and Experimental Media (DXARTS) program, where he is developing an\
  \ artistic agenda which utilizes immersion and perception at the extremes of sensory\
  \ awareness to examine the interplay between identity, memory, surveillance, and\
  \ empathy in an increasingly dissociative, media-centric world. His recent interests\
  \ include fully immersive installations, environmental sound, synthaesthesia, and\
  \ systems art where humans form a critical part in a network of complex emergent\
  \ behavior.\r\n"
