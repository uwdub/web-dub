old-dub-bio: "<p>Completed my Ph.D. in June 2014 from the Electrical Engineering department\
  \ at the University of Washington, co-advised by Professor <a href=\"http://www.ee.washington.edu/faculty/riskin/\"\
  >Eve A. Riskin</a> (EE), Professor <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ladner/\"\
  >Richard E. Ladner</a> (CSE), and Associate Professor <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/\"\
  >Jacob O. Wobbrock </a>(Information School). </p>\r\n<p>My research combined electrical\
  \ engineering and HCI to improving mobile sign language video intelligibility while\
  \ considering resource consumption. In my dissertation, I present the <i>Human Signal\
  \ Intelligibility Model </i> addressing the lack of uniformity video intelligibility\
  \ evaluations are based upon.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Visit my <a href=\"\
