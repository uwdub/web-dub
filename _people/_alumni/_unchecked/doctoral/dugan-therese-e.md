old-dub-bio: I am a PhD candidate in the Learning Science program within the Department
  of Educational Psychology in the UW College of Education. I am advised by Professor
  Reed Stevens. My research interests include the ways in which young children incorporate
  technology into their everyday lives, media studies, pop culture, and documentary
  film-making. My dissertation topic is how and what young children learn from television.
