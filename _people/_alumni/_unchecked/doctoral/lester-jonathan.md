old-dub-bio: I am a fifth-year PhD. candidate in the <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu">Electrical
  Engineering</a> department at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University
  of Washington</a> advised by <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/gaetano">Prof.
  Gaetano Borriello</a>. My main research interest is Ubiquitous computing where I
  work on combining sensing with machine learning techniques to create systems which
  can perform activity inference&mdash;that is inferring what activities a person
  is performing like walking, running, traveling home, etc. The majority of these
  systems focus on medical applications designed to provide users and caregivers more
  insight into people&rsquo;s lives.
