old-dub-bio: "<p>I am Ph.D. Candidate in the Information School University of Washington.\
  \ \r\n\r\n<p>I naturally see phenomena in terms of social structures  So, I bring\
  \ the study of social structures and frame it for the CSCW and HCI communities.\
  \ For example, how status, and social groups contribute to behavioral influence,\
  \ information diffusion, and technology appropriation. \r\n\r\n<p>For my dissertation,\
  \ I study high school youth and how their social identities and social group affiliation\
  \ affects their technology-mediated interactions. This work is funded by a Doctoral\
  \ Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation's Sociology\
  \ Program. It has also received a University of Washington Graduate School Presidential\
  \ Dissertation Fellowship (2011-2012).\r\n\r\n<p>This past summer (2011), I did\
  \ a research internship at the <a href=\"http://fuse.microsoft.com\">FUSE Labs</a>\
  \ at Microsoft Research with Shelly Farnham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, I have worked\
  \ with groups such as the <a href=\"http://vibe.ischool.uw.edu/\">Virtual Information\
  \ Behavior Environments</a>, the<a href=\"http://vsddesign.org\">Value Sensitive\
  \ Design Research Lab</a> and the People and Practices Research Group at Intel amongst\
  \ others. \r\n\r\n<p>I must mention that I am indebted to my committee members:\
  \ Drs. Michael B. Eisenberg (iSchool), David W. McDonald (iSchool) and Kate Stovel\
  \ (sociology). \r\n\r\n<p><i>Note: Please see my website for publications. Thanks.</i><p>"
