old-dub-bio: " Hi! I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the <a class=\"textlink\"\
  \ href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu\">University of Washington</a>. I'm excited\
  \ and fascinated by software built using machine learning algorithms where behavior\
  \ is learned from data rather than manually specified in code. I try to understand\
  \ why applying machine learning is hard and build tools to make development with\
  \ machine learning easier.\r\n            \r\n    As part of the <a class=\"textlink\"\
  \ href=\"http://dub.washington.edu\">DuB</a> group, I am advised by <a class=\"\
  textlink\" href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jfogarty\">James Fogarty</a>\
  \ and <a class=\"textlink\" href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/landay\">James\
  \ Landay</a>. My work is currently funded by Microsoft in the form of a <a class=\"\
  textlink\" href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/global/northam/northam-fellows.aspx#2009_LiveLabs\"\
  >Microsoft Research Fellowship</a>. Previously I was supported by the US government\
  \ in the form of a <a class=\"textlink\" href=\"http://ndseg.asee.org/\">National\
  \ Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship</a>. "
