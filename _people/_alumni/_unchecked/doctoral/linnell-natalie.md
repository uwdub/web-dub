old-dub-bio: "       I am a third-year grad student in the University of \r\n\r\n\
  Washington Computer Science and Engineering Department.  I have \r\n\r\nworked on\
  \ the <a href = \r\n\r\nhttp://classroompresenter.cs.washington.edu/>Classroom \r\
  \n\r\nPresenter</a> project since 2006.  Classroom Presenter is a \r\n\r\nTablet\
  \ PC-based classroom interaction system, and while I have \r\n\r\nworked on the\
  \ code-base, my primary contributions to this \r\n\r\nproject focus on effective\
  \ pedagogy for using Classroom \r\n\r\nPresenter.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tMy primary research\
  \ interests at this point are in the \r\n\r\narea of educational technology for\
  \ developing regions.  In \r\n\r\nparticular, I am interested in investigating techniques\
  \ and \r\n\r\ntechnologies for providing support to the facilitators of \r\n\r\n\
  Tutored Video Instruction deployments.  Tutored Video \r\n\r\nInstruction is a methodology\
  \ whereby classes are recorded and \r\n\r\nthese recordings are then shown to a\
  \ group of students by a \r\n\r\nsemi-skilled facilitator.  During an internship\
  \ at Microsoft \r\n\r\nResearch India I worked with the <a href = \r\n\r\nhttp://www.digitalgreen.org/>Digital\
  \ Green</a> project to \r\n\r\nincrease interactivity in their video sessions (From\
  \ the DG \r\n\r\nwebsite, follow the 'Annotations' link)."
