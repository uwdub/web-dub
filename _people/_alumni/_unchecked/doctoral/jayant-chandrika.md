old-dub-bio: I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University
  of Washington, advised by Professor Richard Ladner. I am interested in mobile phone
  access technology for blind, low-vision, and deaf-blind users. I have worked on
  optical character recognition, automated tactile graphics production, as well as
  touch screen and audio technology for education. I now work on phone-based applications
  to assist in everyday tasks, transportation, and navigation using phone sensors
  and both human and automated web services. My current focus is on helping blind
  people use cameras to find out information about their environment (e.g., facial,
  object, or textual detection/recognition).
