old-dub-bio: "I am a UW <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu\">Computer Science\
  \ & Engineering</a> Ph.D. graduate, class of 2010. I also have a M.S. in CSE from\
  \ UW and a B.S. in <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu\">EECS</a> from UC Berkeley,\
  \ where I was an undergrad research in the Group for User Interface Research. My\
  \ background is in the design, prototyping, and evaluation of mobile, ubiquitous\
  \ applications using low and medium fidelity methods (<i>e.g.</i>, Wizard of Oz\
  \ simulation). I'm especially interested in novel applications of sensing and other\
  \ data sources in enabling new user experiences and interactions to aid people in\
  \ improving their quality of life.\r\nAt UW I worked on the design and implementation\
  \ of an intelligent (adaptive) wayfinding system that helps people with cognitive\
  \ impairments in wayfinding for <a href=\"http://cognitivetech.washington.edu/\"\
  >Project ACCESS</a>. Currently I work on context-aware research and development\
  \ projects as a Research Scientist for <a href=\"http://www.aro.com/\">A.R.O., Inc</a>,\
  \ a startup in Seattle."
