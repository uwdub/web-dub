old-dub-bio: I am a researcher working primarily in the computer supported cooperative
  work, human-computer interaction, and information design communities. My dissertation
  work focuses on understanding how university students use tools and artifacts in
  support of their collaborative project work. The specific goals of my dissertation
  are to elucidate the factors and motivations that drive design students' decisions
  to use specific technologies when coordinating their collaborative work on group
  projects, and to understand how collaboration with and around these technologies
  describes their metawork activities. My recent human-computer interaction studies
  have explored how students integrate e-readers into their academic practices, how
  to develop and test user experience metrics that lead to improved product design,
  and how partners in intimate relationships use online calendar systems. The results
  of my research inform the design of a variety of tools and technologies, from tablet
  computers to shared, digital calendars.
