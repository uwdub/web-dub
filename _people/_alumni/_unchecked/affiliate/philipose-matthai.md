old-dub-bio: "<p>I work on the Technology for Long-Term Care \r\nproject, aimed at\
  \ validating human activity recognition technologies in the \r\nlong-term care setting.\
  \ Previously, I worked on the\r\nHuman Activity \r\nRecognition \r\nproject, which\
  \ developed many of these technologies.\r\n<p>I am interested in modeling human\
  \ state based on sensor inputs. \r\nI am especially interested in techniques that\
  \ scale to modeling most of \r\nday-to-day life inexpensively and in useful detail.\
  \ Techniques I have developed \r\nto this end include ultra-dense sensing, massive\
  \ automatically extracted \r\nstatistical models of daily life, rapid low-overhead\
  \ data labeling and joint \r\ntraining of models using common sense. I am \r\nalso\
  \ interested in applying automated activity monitoring techniques to the \r\nproblem\
  \ of care giving, elder care in particular. More generally, I am interested \r\n\
  in logic, statistical reasoning and programming languages.</p>"
