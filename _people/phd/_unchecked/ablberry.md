old-dub-bio: I am a PhD student in Human Centered Design and Engineering. I hold a
  B.A. in Psychological and Brain Sciences from Dartmouth College. Before joining
  HCDE in 2012 I worked for Epic, a healthcare software company, and CustomCall Data

  collaborative creativity and systems design for improving quality measures in health
  care.
