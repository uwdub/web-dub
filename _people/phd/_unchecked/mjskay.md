old-dub-bio: "I am a PhD student in the department of Computer Science & Engineering\
  \ supervised by <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/jkientz/\">Julie Kientz</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/\">Shwetak Patel</a>.\
  \ I am interested in designing/building/evaluating user interfaces, particularly\
  \ in the area of persuasive technology and personal informatics. I am currently\
  \ developing technology to help people understand and improve their sleep habits.\
  \ Such technology has fascinated me for some time, in part due to my own erratic\
  \ sleep patterns.\r\n\r\nIn a past life, I completed my Master's in Computer Science\
  \ at the University of Waterloo under supervision of <a href=\"http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/mterry/\"\
  >Michael Terry</a>, also studying HCI. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science (also\
  \ from Waterloo), with a minor in Fine Art."
