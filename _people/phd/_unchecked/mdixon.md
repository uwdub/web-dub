old-dub-bio: I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">Computer
  Science &amp; Engineering</a> department at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University
  of Washington</a> advised by <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jfogarty">Prof.
  James Fogarty</a>. My research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
  I am interested in making software (especially interfaces) more flexible and extensible.
  I currently work on Prefab, a system for reverse engineering graphical interfaces
  from their pixels. Prefab let's us explore the question, what if anybody could modify
  any interface? In the past I've also worked on crossing-based interfaces, data analysis
  tools, and dual-display mobile devices.
