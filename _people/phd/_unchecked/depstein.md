old-dub-bio: "I am a third-year PhD student in the <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu\"\
  >Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a>department at the <a href=\"http://www.washington.edu\"\
  >University of Washington</a> co-advised by <a href=\"/people/jfogarty\">James Fogarty</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/people/smunson\">Sean Munson</a>. I am interested in Personal Informatics\
  \ devices (such as pedometers or GPS on smartphones) and how Social Sharing (such\
  \ as posting to Facebook) can be used within this domain.\r\n\r\nI graduated with\
  \ a BS in Computer Science in 2012 from the <a href=\"http://www.virginia.edu\"\
  >University of Virginia</a>, where I did research under <a href=\"http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/\"\
  >Kevin Skadron</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~bmeyer2/index.html\"\
  >Brett Meyer</a> on processor redundancy."
