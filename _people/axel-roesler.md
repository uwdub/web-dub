old-dub-bio: "<p>Dr. Axel Roesler is an Associate Professor for <a href=\"http://art.washington.edu/design/undergraduate/interaction-design/about-interaction-design/\"\
  >Interaction Design</a> at the <a href=\"http://art.washington.edu/design/\">Division\
  \ of Design at the UW School of Art</a>. He is also an Adjunct Associate Professor\
  \ at the Department of Human Centered Design and Engineering. He received his Ph.D.\
  \ in Cognitive Systems Engineering with a specialization in Human-centered Design\
  \ from The Ohio State University. He also holds an M.F.A in Industrial Design from\
  \ The Ohio State University and a Diplom in Industrial Design (equivalent to M.A.)\
  \ from Burg Giebichenstein, Hochschule f\xFCr Kunst und Design (University of Art\
  \ and Design) in Halle, Germany. He came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar\
  \ in 1998.\r\n<p><a href=\"http://art.washington.edu/design/design-faculty/axel-roesler/\"\
  >Dr. Roesler</a> is the chair of the Interaction Design program at the Division\
  \ of Design, a program that offers a M.Des and B.Des in Interaction Design. He offers\
  \ Interaction Design studios <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/ixd/\">(DESIGN\
  \ 383 and DESIGN 483)</a> that are open to design students and students from HCI-related\
  \ fields to explore the design of interactions, interfaces, services and new products\
  \ in interdisciplinary design teams <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/roesler/video/roesler_IxD_dub_talk_08_2009.mov\"\
  >(see examples in this slide/audio capture of Prof. Roesler's DUB talk from August\
  \ 2009)</a>. DUB provides a perfect platform to facilitate the convergence between\
  \ Design and Human-computer Interaction pools of expertise to pioneer cross-disciplinary\
  \ education for future human-computer interaction design professionals.</p>\r\n\
  <p>His research interests include the interactive, visual, and dynamic display of\
  \ information and the impact of innovation in everyday life. Areas of application\
  \ are information visualization, coordination of perspectives on data, and user\
  \ experience design.</p>\r\n<p>Recent research projects include a research contract\
  \ with Boeing on <a href=\"http://www.washington.edu/news/2011/04/27/rethinking-work-environments-through-interaction-design/\"\
  >new interaction design concepts for the future commercial flight deck</a>, interaction\
  \ design of real-time documentation during emergency response, new concepts for\
  \ interacting with procedural online instructions, and an interface framework to\
  \ control perspectives in dynamic spatial settings. Industry partners and research\
  \ collaborators include Boeing, Microsoft, Intel, Amazon, Group Health Cooperative,\
  \ and the Institute for Simulation and Interprofessional Studies at the UW School\
  \ of Medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><p>Sample UW Interaction Design studio projects:</p>\r\
