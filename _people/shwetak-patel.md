old-dub-bio: "<a href=\"http://www.shwetak.com\">Shwetak N. Patel</a> is an Assistant\
  \ Professor in the departments of <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu\">Computer\
  \ Science and Engineering</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ee.washington.edu\">Electrical\
  \ Engineering</a>. His research interests are in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction,\
  \ Ubiquitous Computing, and User Interface Software and Technology. He is particularly\
  \ interested in developing easy-to-deploy sensing technologies and approaches for\
  \ location and activity recognition applications. He is also interested in exploring\
  \ novel interaction techniques for mobile devices, mobile sensing systems, and wireless\
  \ power technologies. Shwetak's most recent research has been in building a new\
  \ class of low-cost and easy-to-deploy sensing systems for the home to enable in-situ\
  \ human-centered research, called Infrastructure Mediated Sensing, which leverages\
  \ existing utility infrastructures in a home to support whole house sensing.  \r\
  \n<br><br>\r\nShwetak received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href=\"\
  http://www.gatech.edu\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> in 2008 and B.S. in\
  \ Computer Science in 2003. He was also the Assistant Director of the <a href=\"\
