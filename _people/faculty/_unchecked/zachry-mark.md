old-dub-bio: 'Mark Zachry is associate professor of Human Centered Design & Engineering
  at the University of Washington. His research areas include the communicative practices
  of organizations, communication design, and the rhetoric of technology. A focus
  of his recent work has been on the development of meaningful models of communication
  as it is practiced in organizations. This work has focused on characterizing knowledge
  work in terms of typical uses of texts and related mediating artifacts. A related
  strand of his research develops theoretical constructs to account for the uses of
  discourse in the regulation of individual practices in organizations. This project
  is the focus of his co-edited collection, Communicative Practices in Workplaces
  and the Professions: Cultural Perspectives on the Regulation of Discourse and Organizations.  '
