old-dub-bio: "I am a faculty member in the <a href=\"http://uwtc.washington.edu\"\
  >Department of Technical Communication</a> at the <a href=\"www.washington.edu\"\
  > University of Washington</a>, and also a Fellow at the<a href=\"cyber.law.harvard.edu\"\
  > Berkman Center for Internet and Society</a> at Harvard University. \r\n\r\nI have\
  \ a background in rhetoric and cultural studies which informs my work on information\
  \ technologies and international development (ICT4D). I run the <a href=\"depts.washington.edu/caict\"\
  >CAICT </a> project, a multi-year NSF grant studying cross-cultural impact of ICT\
  \ adoption, and I work extensively with the <a href=\"www.cis.washington.edu\">UW\
  \ Center for Information and Society<a> on ICT4D projects.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy approach\
  \ to ICT4D emphasizes the idea of diversity and technology by focusing on ICTs in\
  \ developing countries in order to counteract what could be called a failure of\
  \ imagination in terms of how devices, software, and services are designed. The\
  \ potential benefit of ICTs across domains has been documented, but much currently\
  \ available technology doesn't adequately consider infrastructure, regulatory, and\
  \ usage environments. My <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/ddi/\">Design for\
  \ Digital Inclusion (DDI) </a> group applies theory-based analyses of culture and\
  \ technology to examine how technology is used in diverse settings and demonstrate\
  \ how technologists, social scientists, and humanities scholars can collaborate\
  \ on technology-related development and implementation projects.\r\nI also run the\
  \ Digital Games Research Group at UW (currently on hiatus).\r\n<br>In 2008, I was\
  \ a visiting faculty fellow at Microsoft Research and a Fellow at the Berkman Center\
  \ at Harvard University."
