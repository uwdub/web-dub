old-dub-bio: "I'm a faculty member in CSE working on \"transparent computation\" in\
  \ various forms: teaching math and cs through image processing, making educational\
  \ assessment more powerful, flexible, and understandable, and helping people to\
  \ pose and solve problems using computational tools.  I teach a course called \"\
  Pixels, Numbers and Programs\" that integrates an introduction to image processing\
  \ with content from math, perceptual psychology, and programming with Python.  I\
  \ also teach a course on artificial intelligence (using Python), and a course on\
  \ data structures and algorithms (with Java). I'm a poast member of the steering\
  \ committee for the IEEE Symposia on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing,\
  \ and served on the Board of Governors of the IEEE Computer Society. In 2013 I chair\
  \ the steering committee for the journal, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies.\
  \ I am currently directing research on collaborative design using the classical\
  \ theory of problem solving, and I participate in the NIH Center for Defining and\
  \ Treating Written Language Disabilities.\r\n "
