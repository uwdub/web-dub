old-dub-bio: I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering
  at the University of Washington, and adjunct faculty in the Information School.
  My principal research interests currently concern designing for civic participation
  and engagement, sustainability (in particular around land use and transportation),
  and designing for human values. In a previous life I worked quite a bit on <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints">constraint-based
  languages and systems</a>, and on object-oriented languages.
