old-dub-bio: "My interest is in crossroads. Where creative and analytical disciplines\
  \ meet. Where humans and computers intersect. Where the digital and analog merge.\
  \ The overlay between arts and sciences.</br></br>\r\n\r\nSpring of 2015 I have\
  \ joined the full-time faculty of the school of design at UW and will be focused\
  \ on teaching in the MHCI+D program and also in the design school. Incredibly excited\
  \ to help students explore their paths and work with the exceptional DUB faculty.\
  \ Dynamic time of growth and opportunity at UW right now...</br></br>\r\n\r\nPrior\
  \ to this I was the Director of User Experience for Aditi Technologies (a subsidiary\
  \ of Mountain View based Symphony-Teleca). We built web, mobile, spatial and connected\
  \ digital experiences for startups and Fortune 100 companies (Boeing, Microsoft,\
  \ LA Fitness, GE Healthcare, etc). Great job with a fun, dynamic and energized global\
  \ team. As the UX director I spent most by time championing users and advocating\
  \ for sensible aesthetics and ease of use in the technological space. In the past\
  \ I worked as the senior UX designer at NCSOFT, an international publisher of MMORPG\
  \ titles (Aion, Lineage 2, Guild Wars 1 & 2, Wildstar, City of Heroes). While there\
  \ I worked on the Guild Wars 2 website as well as the e-commerce solutions that\
  \ supported a million dollars in digital sales per day. (Fastest selling MMORPG\
  \ in history!) Prior to this I was the founding interactive art director/ux architect\
  \ for Slalom Consulting. Before the economy went berzerk in 2009, for 5 years I\
  \ had a small interactive studio in Fremont called Tellous. Currently the website\
  \ serves as a portfolio for personal work, which you can find here <a href=\"http://www.tellous.com\"\
  >www.tellous.com</a></br></br>\r\n\r\nYears ago my background was actually as a\
  \ fine artist working in traditional woodblock printmaking (University of Puget\
  \ Sound), then visual communication (Cornish College of the Arts), and finally HCI\
  \ and User Centered Design (through the Human Centered Design and Engineering masters\
  \ program at University of Washington). I've been working in Design and UX for about\
  \ 15 years now...</br></br>\r\n\r\nFor fun I play in post-punk bands (<a href=\"\
  https://biographyofferns.bandcamp.com/\">Biography of Ferns</a>), compose classical\
  \ music, make sculpture, read 20th century French surrealism, wander/hike, write\
  \ short stories, play tennis and basketball, sketch like crazy in pubs and urban\
  \ environments and generally just try to explore and know as much as I can about\
  \ the world. Later in life I can see myself becoming a Jungian analyst/depth psychologist.</br></br>\r\
  \n\r\n\r\n"
