old-dub-bio: "All of my work going back to doctoral research into human memory long\
  \ ago at Carnegie-Mellon has been motivated by the observation that information\
  \ -- at the right place and time, in the right form, and coherently organized --\
  \ can help us to be very smart. Conversely, information missing or messy can overwhelm\
  \ and make us stupid.  How can we use information and informational tools as an\
  \ extension to ourselves and according to the lives we want to live? This enduring\
  \ interest has found expression in articles the areas of personal information management\
  \ (PIM), human-computer interaction, information retrieval and human cognition.\
  \ Recently, I wrote the book \u201CKeeping Found Things Found: The Study and Practice\
  \ of Personal Information Management\u201D and also edited the book \u201CPersonal\
  \ Information Management\u201D (with Jaime Teevan as co-editor)."
