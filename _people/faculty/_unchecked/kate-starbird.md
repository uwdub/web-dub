old-dub-bio: "Kate Starbird is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Human Centered\
  \ Design & Engineering (HCDE) at the University of Washington. Dr. Starbird\u2019\
  s research, which is situated within the fields of HCI and CSCW, examines interaction\
  \ and collaboration as enabled, supported, and structured by social media and other\
  \ online tools. She investigates both large-scale and small group online interaction\
  \ within the context of crises and other mass disruption events, studying how digital\
  \ volunteers and other members of the connected crowd work to filter and shape the\
  \ information space. As part of this research, she co-created and developed the\
  \ infrastructure to support the \"Tweak the Tweet\" project, an innovation for using\
  \ Twitter more effectively as a channel for reporting actionable information during\
  \ crisis. Her current research includes an effort to design tools to help emergency\
  \ responders and digital volunteers make sense of the massive amounts of social\
  \ media data available in the wake of disaster events.\r\n\r\nDr. Starbird received\
  \ her BS in Computer Science from Stanford University in 1997 and her PhD in Technology,\
  \ Media and Society from the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado in 2012.\
  \ She received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her PhD work."
