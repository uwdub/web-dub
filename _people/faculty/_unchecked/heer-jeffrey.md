old-dub-bio: I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at
  the University of Washington, where I work on human-computer interaction, visualization
  and social computing. My research investigates the perceptual, cognitive and social
  factors involved in making sense of large data collections, resulting in new interactive
  systems for visual analysis and communication. The visualization tools developed
  by my lab (D3, Protovis, Flare, Prefuse) are used by researchers, companies and
  thousands of data enthusiasts around the world. My group has received Best Paper
  and Honorable Mention awards at the premier venues in Human-Computer Interaction
  and Information Visualization (ACM CHI, ACM UIST, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST). In 2009
  I was named to MIT Technology Review's TR35; in 2012 I was named a Sloan Foundation
  Research Fellow. I hold BS, MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University
  of California, Berkeley.
