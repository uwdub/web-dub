old-dub-bio: I am a founding member and current director of the <a href="http://dmg.be.washington.edu">Design
  Machine Group</a> within the Department of Architecture, College of Built Environments
  (previously, the College of Architecture and Urban Planning). We investigate aspects
  of computing in the field of architecture, including topics related to Simulation,
  CSCW, HCI, and digital fabrication. My current interests include individual and
  group presence awareness (CSCW), cognition and the role of ambiguity in design,
  and online communities. The DMG is also an interdepartmental collaborative research
  studio and home to students from across campus, as well as those in our Master of
  Science in Architecture Program in Design Computing.
