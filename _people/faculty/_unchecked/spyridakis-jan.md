  Jan Spyridakis</a>, Professor in Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University
  of Washington, specializes in user experience research and design. Her research
  interests include remote user assessment; experimental methods and tools for assessing
  users remotely; and assessment of the effect of information design variables on
  users. In her <a href=https://depts.washington.edu/ibuxl/weblabux/>Internet-Based
  User Experience Lab</a>, she and her students research how design features of online
  information affect users'' behavior, comprehension, and perceptions. Her lab has
  also been developing WebLabUX, a tool to support the conduct of remote user testing.
  This software package allows researchers and Web site stakeholders to measure user
  behavior and performance on an instrumented Web site as well as test design variations.
  Dr. Spyridakis has been honored by receiving eight awards for her research and six
  for her pedagogy. '
