old-dub-bio: 'I am an Associate Professor in both the Information School and the Division
  of Biomedical & Health Informatics in the Medical School at the University of Washington.
  I received my Ph.D. in Medical Informatics from Stanford University, my M.S. in
  Computer Science from the University of Texas, and my B.S. in Electrical and Computer
  Engineering from the University of Kansas. My published papers span a wide range
  of topics whose central theme is to understand the problem of information overload
  in a variety of health contexts and to develop new types technology to address those
  problems. I received an NSF CAREER Award for my work on literature-based discovery
  systems, am on the editorial board for the Journal of Biomedical Informatics, and
  serve on the standing NIH grant-review committee for the National Library of Medicine. '
